# Hello, and welcome to the Phrase Randomiser.
# This simple script exists to take a whole load of phrases and memes and randomly choose them.
# This is basically me playing around with lists and the random library to see what I can do while learning Python.
# This collection of memes, phrases, and slogans can (and likely will) be very handy for some, so please feel free to copy this code or add to it :3
# One thing you can use this for is to pipe it into cowsay (or simular) with "<path to this script>/phraserandomiser.py | cowsay"
# Anyway, have fun, contribute more at https://github.com/abbiistabbii/pythonscripts/blob/main/phraserandomiser.py!
